<h3>It's not cabbage soup's fault that more people don't love it. Seriously, it's that name, right? Cabbage soup: It doesn't have an immediately delicious ring to it, like Ree Drummond's Perfect Potato Soup. But don't let the name keep you awayâ€”this hearty, tasty, and yes, even healthy soup is surprisingly delicious, inexpensive, and super easy to make. It may even spark a love of all things cabbage! Add it to your list of the best soup recipes to warm you up on a cold night. This is a great meal-prep recipe to make on a Sunday and enjoy for lunch all week long!</h3>
<h1>PREPARATION</h1>
<pre>
In a large Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrot, salt, pepper, and fennel seeds, if using. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are slightly softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the cabbage and garlic to the pot and stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
2
Add the broth, tomatoes, and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer; cover, and cook until the cabbage is tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in the white beans and simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Remove the bay leaves.
3
Serve in soup bowls topped with parsley.
