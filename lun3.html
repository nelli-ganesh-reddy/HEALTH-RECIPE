<h1>PREPARATION</h1>
<pre>
1. First, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a pot on medium-low heat. The butter should melt and slightly simmer, but not burn.

2. Next, add 2 bay leaves and fry them in the butter for a few seconds until lightly browned, but again, not burned.

If you live in India, you can also use 1 medium tej patta or 2 small tej patta instead of the bay leaves.

3. Add ½ teaspoon of finely chopped garlic and ⅓ cup of finely chopped onions to the pan, and stir.

8. Stir occasionally and keep an eye on the consistency of the mixture. If the liquids dry up and the tomatoes begin to stick, then add a splash of water at a time and stir.

But be sure to not add too much water or you’ll dilute the delicious flavors. After the tomatoes have softened, remove from the heat and cool.

Remember to take out the bay leaves (or tej patta if you have used it) and discard.

Blend Tomatoes
9. Once the tomato mixture has cooled to a point that’s safe to work with, add it to a blender jar. You could also use an immersion blender.

11. You have the option of straining the puree through a strainer for an even smoother soup, but this step isn’t necessary.

14. Pour the tomato puree back into the pot, and add 1 cup water. Stir and combine well. Depending on the consistency you prefer, you can add a little less or more water – taking care that the soup does not become very thick or watery and runny.

Note that instead of water you could also use homemade Vegetable Stock which will surely add more flavors to the soup.
