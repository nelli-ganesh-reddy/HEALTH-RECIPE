How To Make Sweet Potato Salad
INGREDIENTS
Sweet Potatoes: Before roasting your sweet potatoes, peel and cube them before tossing in olive oil and seasoning with salt and pepper. I like to cut into 1” cubes, but the main thing is to make sure that all of your pieces are the same size.
Red Onion: Red onion gives the perfect sharp bite, and since we’re roasting them, they add a more subtle, sweet flavor to this salad. If you don’t have red onions, shallots would also work well here.
Dried Cranberries: I felt that this salad needed another sweet factor, which led me to dried cranberries. They are not only the perfect balance of sweet and tart, but are perfect for fall.
Feta: Crumbled feta not only adds that cheesy factor, but also gives a salty boost. Because of that, make sure to taste your salad before adding any extra salt in case the feta is enough for you. Not a feta fan? Swap it out for creamy goat cheese.
Parsley: Forget leafy greens—freshly chopped parsley adds a boost of freshness to this salad. You can experiment with other herbs, but I highly recommend parsley.
Dressing: I create the simple dressing by combining apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, honey, ground cumin, paprika, and extra-virgin olive oil (use your favorite brand, or checkout our list of the best olive oil brands). If you don’t have any apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar would also be a fine substitution—just make sure and taste as you go. Honey adds the perfect sweet touch, but a little bit of maple syrup would also add that necessary sweetness.
