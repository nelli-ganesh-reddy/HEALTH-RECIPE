<h3>Grain bowls are not only a great way to nourish yourself in the middle of the day. They're also easy to meal prep! These grain bowl recipes align with the Mediterranean diet, one of the healthiest eating patterns in the world. This is because they incorporate lots of vegetables, healthy fats, whole grains and lean proteins for a balanced and filling lunch all in one bowl or container. Recipes like our Chickpea & Quinoa Bowl with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce and Meal-Prep Chili-Lime Chicken Bowls are convenient, energizing and flavorful meals to help get you through the day ahead.</h3>
<h1>PREPARATION</h1>
<pre>
Place peppers, almonds, 2 tablespoons oil, garlic, paprika, cumin and crushed red pepper (if using) in a mini food processor. Puree until fairly smooth.
Combine quinoa, olives, red onion and the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a medium bowl.
To serve, divide the quinoa mixture among 4 bowls and top with equal amounts of the chickpeas, cucumber and the red pepper sauce. Sprinkle with feta and parsley.
