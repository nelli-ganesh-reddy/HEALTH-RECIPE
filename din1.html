<h3>Stuffed Sweet Potatoes are a hearty, wholesome vegetarian meal packed with bold Mediterranean flavors. To make them, I fill roasted sweet potatoes with garlicky chickpeas, tangy sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, and lime, then top them with creamy avocado crema. Perfect for a cozy lunch or dinner, this dish is as satisfying as it is easy!</h3>
<h1>PREPARATION</h1>
<pre>
Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 400Â°F. While the oven is heating, wash 4 small to medium sweet potatoes, scrubbing them to remove any dirt. Dry them off. Using a fork, poke holes all over the sweet potatoes. Line a sheet pan with foil and arrange them on top. An overhead photo of 4 sweet potatoes on a foil-lined sheet pan.
Roast the sweet potatoes. Bake on the middle rack of the heated oven for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or until the sweet potatoes are fork tender.A close up of 3 sweet potatoes on a foil-lined sheet pan.
Make the chickpea filling. Meanwhile, heat two tablespoons extra virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. Add 3 chopped shallots and cook for about 3 minutes, tossing occasionally. Add 2 minced garlic cloves and cook for about 30 seconds, then add 2 (15-ounce) drained and rinsed cans of chickpeas and 1/4 cup chopped sundried tomatoes. Cook for about 10 minutes until the chickpeas are tender and warmed through. Add 3 cups baby spinach and a big pinch each of kosher salt and black pepper. Toss just until the spinach is just wilted. Zest and juice 1 lime, and add the lime juice to the pan, stirring to combine. Remove from the heat. An overhead photo of the filled for the stuffed sweet potatoes in a skillet.
Stuff the sweet potatoes. When the sweet potatoes are ready, remove them from the oven and slice them partway through the center so that they remain intact on the bottom. Open the sweet potatoes up a bit to make room for the filling. Heap spoonfuls of the chickpea mixture to fill the cavity of each sweet potato.
