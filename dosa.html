<h3>Dosa is the ever-popular South Indian breakfast of crispy crepes made with ground rice and lentil batter that is fermented. With just a handful of ingredients learn to make the classic Dosa recipe from scratch with my easy video and step-by-step photos. I also cover making your own dosa batter in a blender or mixer-grinder, tips on fermentation and cooking dosa to help you make the best dosa – crispy, soft and so good to dunk in a bowl of Coconut Chutney or piping hot Sambar.</h3>
<h1>PREPARATION</h1>
<pre>Soaking the lentils, rice, making the batter, fermenting the batter calls for time, planning and some prep work. So for your ease of understanding, I have divided this step by step guide into 4 main parts:

Soaking rice and lentils
Making dosa batter in a blender or mixer-grinder
Fermenting dosa batter
Making dosa

Soak Rice and Lentils
1. In a bowl take ½ cup idli rice or parboiled rice along with ½ cup regular rice. Instead of adding regular rice, you can also make the dosa with a total of 1 cup idli rice as I have shown in the video.

Kindly note that the video has the recipe ingredients doubled in proportion.

2. To the same bowl, add ¼ cup urad dal and ⅛ teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi).

7. Drain all the water and add the soaked ingredients to a mixer grinder or a blender.

8. Add ⅔ to ¾ cup water and grind or blend till you get a fine grainy consistency of rice in the batter. A smooth consistency of the batter is also fine.

If the mixer gets heated up, then stop and wait for some minutes. When the mixer cools down, grind again.

Depending on the jar capacity, you can grind everything once or in two batches. I ground in two batches and added a total of ¾ cup water.
